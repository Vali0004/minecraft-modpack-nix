# modpack-nix
## What is this?
### Welcome! This is a way to generate a .nix file with a list of all the files in a Minecraft CurseForge modpack folder.
#### While yes, it's not very nix-like just due to how it works, it's the only reliable way to manage CurseForge modpacks.
#### Unless someone wants to take the manifest.json (or converting to .toml), and do hashes for 600 files (which be my guest, have fun with that), this does the job.
## How do I use it?
#### Right now, it's just a makefile as I'm too lazy to setup the stuff for nixos, plus, I'm on Windows half the time :P
